The philosophy of the project is to use cheap, of the shelf, easily built and easily repairable components. I want to allow versatility so that the relays can be set up to highlight and work with the natural character that is associated with individual fencing clubs. Standard, commercial repeater lights lack the character and are unable to mesh well with a rooms environment despite being significantly more expensive. The Arduinos and relays can be bought for under $20 and depending on your choice of LED lighting and power supplies, it the entire setup could reasonably run under $100. The trade off is that it will take so care and effort to plan and setup the initial repeater system but with a modicum of planning and persistence, it can reasonably create a unique, custom and affordable enhancement to a fencing club.


This project uses two ESP8266 Wemos D1 Minis to receive output data from a [Favero scoring machine](https://www.favero.com/en2_fencing_sport_electronic_scoreboard_fencing_signalling_equipment_apparatus_for_foil_sword_epee_sabre-29-17.html) and then relay it to another ESP8266 via wifi which will then activate relays to corresponding to the lights on the fencing box.

Of note, ESP8266 Wemos D1 Mini that is used to parse the output data from the scoring machine must be a specific version, specifically it must use the [CH340 chip](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806703939501.html). There are other ways to work around this, but using this specific chipset is the easiest and most straightforward. 

The electrical connections can be seen on [Schematic_Favero_Parser_and_Receiver](Schematic_Favero_Parser_and_Receiver.pdf). The code for the Transmitter was compiled on the Arduino IDE with the parser code being [8266_Parser_and_Transmitter_Faster_Retransmit_TCFC](8266_Parser_and_Transmitter_Faster_Retransmit_TCFC) and the receiver code being [8266_Receiver_Strip_Lights_Four_Relay](8266_Receiver_Strip_Lights_Four_Relay).


The size of the Favero data output is [RJ11] (https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807761034393.html) and a [100 ohm resistor] (https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806360281394.html) is required between the ground of the Wemos board and the ground pin for the RJ11 connections. The outside and inside connections for the RJ11 are actually connected within the Favero scoring machine, so flipping the wires upside down by accident, should not cause any noticeable affect on the operation.
